        "1. Describe the Naives Bayes model mathematically. How do you construct the model from the data and make predictions using it?\n",
        "1. What are the assumptions of the Naive Bayes model. Does our data actually obey those assumptions?\n",
        "1. Add more metrics that measure class-specific performance and the behavior of the model.\n",
        "    1. How often does the model predict each class label?\n",
        "    1. For which one does the model perform better/worse?\n",
        "    1. Try to do some error analysis of the model.\n",
        "1. Play around with the vocabulary size (10 words, 100 words, 1k words, 10k words) and see how accuracy changes with vocabulary size. What is the trade-off that we are doing by varying vocabulary size?\n",
        "1. The question above asks us to test different values of our feature size, which is a form of hyperparameter tuning. How can you automate this process using SciKit-learn to get the best set of values?\n",
        "1. Sometimes, review writers may use rare synonyms of meaningful words or may misspell words. This is especially common in real data, and this may lead to our model to not perform as well. Can you modify the code to handle these cases?\n",
        "1. Try implementing n-gram TF-IDF features and use the model. Does it perform better or worse?\n",
        "1. Create a command-line tool or web application that accepts text input and returns the sentiment predicted by our model. What would the design of your application look like? What are the components for processing the text, creating the features and predicting the output?\n",
        "1. Try to implement your own MultinomialNB class. What are some of implementation issues you should consider and how will you handle them? Here are a few:\n",
        "    1. Many words are incredibly rare - the probability of some words would be in the order of $10^{-6}$. Naive Bayes involves multiplying several of these probabilities, so the probability of the text could be something like $10^{-200}$, which is not representable by floating point values. How would you handle this?\n",
        "    2. Writing for-loops that iterates over n-grams may be very slow, how can you optimize this?\n",
        "1. In the Naive Bayes model, some words may occur rarely in one class and may be more common in the other class. These are usually the most informative words for our classification. \n",
        "    1. The odds of the words would be either very large or close to 0. \n",
        "    1. That is, the ratio $ \\frac{p(w | pos)}{p(w | neg)} $ would be very close to infinity or 0 due to the numerator or denominator being the larger quantity. \n",
        "    1. If they are equally likely in both classes, then the ratio will be closer to 1.\n",
        "    1. Look at the attributes of the MultinomialNB class, and see which ones can be used to obtain this metric.\n",
        "    1. Do the words you see from this analysis  make intuitive sense? If some words don't make sense, they could be a source of error. Identify such cases in your dataset."
